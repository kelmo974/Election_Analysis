# Election_Analysis
Aggregations and analysis of election data for Colorado counties.


## Purpose

Election data was sourced from a .csv files and imported into a VS Code python interpretor by relying on base modules csv and os. Once the data was read, a series of lists and dictionaries was created so that variables could be assigned before carrying out aggregations. Results of the aggreations were written to a .txt file that is found along this README and the PyPoll_Challenge file. 

## Results

Not surpsingly, Denver county recorded the greatest number of votes cast. This heavily influenced the election outcome. Denver votes accounted for 82.% of the total votes, while Jefferson and Arapahoe provided 10.5% and 6.7%, respectively.
